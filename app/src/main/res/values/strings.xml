        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        <br>What is counseling? Is it for me?</br>
One of the four global citizens faces mental health issues. Counselling helps them to deal with their problems, motivates them to make healthier changes in their lifestyle and teaches them how to cope with stressful and emotionally challenging situations in life.

My Restful Mind’s therapy services will help you if you are facing any of the following issues:

Exam stress
Insomnia
Relationship troubles
Addiction and substance use
Suicidal ideation and depression
Gender and sexuality issues
Anger management and anxiety
PTSD
Life coaching
Life transitions
Medical detox
By talking to one of our trained psychologists and certified professionals you can prevent the seemingly small issues from transitioning into bigger problems. Counseling or therapy is not necessary only for mental illnesses, it can be used by you to generally talk about your life and whatever is happening in it with a certified professional without the fear of being judged.

 <br> </br>
        <br> How will I get to know if therapy is working or not?</br>
My Restful Mind’s therapy services are entirely focused on the client’s needs – a discussion, a call out for help or an encounter to better the client’s well-being either physically or mentally.

The advice given to you will result in a positive change in your life indicating that therapy is indeed working. It is important to note that every now and then you will reveal sentiments that indicate how you feel, and this is all part and parcel of the entire procedure

        <br> How long do I need to take therapy before it shows results?</br>
        It depends on a multitude of factors from the plan you choose, to the approach of your therapist, how compliant you are towards healing and therapy, your cooperation and home environment, and many other factors that vary with each client and hence there is no standard prognosis or results showing in a certain time. However, the average CBT ranges from 6 months – 1 year.

        <br> How is video therapy different from face to face therapy?</br>
        Studies have suggested that video guiding is in fact more compelling and powerful than one to one conversation. Plus, it can be done on the go without any time constraints.
        However, it is also essential to note that advising is based entirely on individuals and each advice may vary from person to person. Some people may find video counselling more effective than others.

        <br> Can my therapy session be recorded?</br>
        No, your therapy sessions cannot be recorded by the therapist as Doxy.me is a secure platform that does not allow for the sessions to be recorded. Moreover, therapists are legally obligated to not disclose the discussions that take place during therapy.
